# pneumoniaclassification
Used PyTorch to classify whether pneumonia is present in an image

Preprocessed Dicom images to get them ready for PyTorch's dataloader

Trained my model using PyTorch lightning

Used a Class Activation Map to display where in the image the model focused on when making its determination
